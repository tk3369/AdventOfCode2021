# Advent of Code 2021

Having fun again this year. My priorities are:

1. Learn different ways for solving the same problem
2. Write clean and easy-to-understand code
3. Create animations
4. Optimize performance

It's too early to say but I will try to finish the puzzles with Julia language. When time is allowed, I will solve them in Rust as well.
